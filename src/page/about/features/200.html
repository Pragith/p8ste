<p class="info">This is a list of what we do so as to make you feel at home.</p>


<h2><strong>Auto-detected languages</strong></h2>
<p>All the pastebins out there ask you again and again to tell which language you're using. It's {% now "Y" %}, you're already pasting some code, you don't have to tell in which language it was written. We guess.</p>


<h2><strong>Syntax highlighting</strong></h2>
<p>It's easier to read some code when it's not written black on white. We make you comments slightly grey, put some colors in your keywords...</p>


<h2><strong>Threads</strong></h2>
<p>Because you want to know when someone fork your paste, but you want to know about what you forked from. The whole picture. Threads.</p>


<h2><strong>Lists</strong></h2>
<p>Wanna see several pastes on one page ? Lists !</p>


<h2><strong>Diff</strong></h2>
<p>Sometimes you wan't to see clearly what's the difference between two pastes. That's what diff is for.</p>


<h2><strong>Remote diff</strong></h2>
<p>Maybe the file you want to compute a diff with is not on PrengePASTE. Then just use remote diffs.</p>
